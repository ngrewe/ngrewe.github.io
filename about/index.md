I'm a software developer living at the lovely Baltic coast of Germany. In other
aspects of my life, I'm also a classicist (so greek letters don't scare me even
if they don't denote variables…) and a philosopher (which gives me
license to get excited about any topic, no matter how obscure).

In the software theatre, my main areas of interest currently include distributed
systems, language interoperability, as well as deployment and automation. I enjoy
working with a variety of different languages and technologies, but I'm particularly
fond of Objective-C – down to the nitty-gritty runtime details.

<h4>Philosophical interests</h4>

* Plato and Aristotle, as well as their ancient and medieval commentators.
* Metaphysics and (Formal) Ontology
* Logic (especially paraconsistent logic and proof theory)
